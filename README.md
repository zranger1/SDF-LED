# SDF-LED
Tools for using signed distance fields and other shader-influenced rendering techniques with 2D/3D addressable LED controllers. 

Signed distance functions provide a simple, compact, flexible way to draw, mix, texture and shape 2D and 3D geometry. No polygon meshes or display lists required. Instead, we use a mathematical function - a signed distance function (SDF) - that calculates the distance between a point in space and the surface of an object.

This rendering technique is most often associated with ray tracing and GPU shaders, but it also works very well with
addressable LEDs.   

// TODO - expand introduction, build small tutorial, and add more pointers to relevant things on the web.
